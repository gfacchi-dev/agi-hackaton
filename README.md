# AI-Powered Pre-Visit Charting Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to streamline the pre-visit charting process. It interacts with patients using clear, plain-language questions to build a structured pre-visit chart in the Concise Clinical Assessment Documentation (CCAD) format. The assistant gathers information incrementally, updating the report only with confirmed details, and carefully avoids making clinical judgments or assumptions. Once all necessary information is collected, it politely concludes the conversation and offers to assist with scheduling the appointment.

## Architecture

The project is organized into three main components:

-   **`frontend-patient`**: The patient-facing interface where the AI assistant interacts with users. It asks questions one at a time and gathers the information needed for the pre-visit chart.

-   **`frontend-pre-chart`**: An internal-facing application for healthcare professionals. It displays the structured CCAD chart generated by the AI assistant, allowing for review and integration into the clinical workflow.

-   **`backend`**: The core of the application, built with Python and FastAPI. It uses LangChain and Ollama to power the conversational AI, manage the state of the interaction, and construct the final CCAD report.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
-   [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
-   [Python](https://www.python.org/) (3.11 or higher)
-   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

### Frontend Setup

#### Patient Frontend (`frontend-patient`)

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend-patient
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The patient frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### Pre-Chart Frontend (`frontend-pre-chart`)

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend-pre-chart
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    The pre-chart frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5174` (or the next available port).

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv venv
    uv pip sync
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Run the backend server:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
